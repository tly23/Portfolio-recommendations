# Portfolio Recommendations Frontend

This folder contains the frontend components for the Portfolio Recommendations project, focusing on visualizing portfolio risk vs. reward through interactive heatmaps and charts.

## Overview

The frontend allows users to:

1. Select their risk profile (risk_averse, risk_neutral, risk_loving)
2. Choose an investment horizon (3 months, 6 months, 1 year)
3. View a heatmap visualization of portfolio risk vs. reward across different market regimes
4. Explore detailed portfolio allocations for each market regime

## Files

- `portfolio_dashboard.py`: Main Streamlit dashboard application
- `generate_portfolio_results.py`: Helper script to generate portfolio optimization results for the dashboard

## How to Run

### Step 1: Generate Portfolio Results

First, run the portfolio results generator to create the necessary data for the dashboard:

```bash
python generate_portfolio_results.py
```

This will create a `portfolio_optimization_results.csv` file that contains the portfolio optimization data needed for the heatmap visualization.

### Step 2: Run the Dashboard

Run the Streamlit dashboard application:

```bash
pip install streamlit plotly pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
streamlit run portfolio_dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will open in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

## Dashboard Features

### Heatmap Visualization

The main feature is a heatmap that visualizes:

- **X-axis**: Expected Return (%)
- **Y-axis**: Expected Risk (%)
- **Color intensity**: Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted return)
- **Star markers**: Optimal portfolios for each market regime

### Portfolio Details

For each selected market regime, the dashboard displays:

- Key metrics (expected return, risk, Sharpe ratio)
- Portfolio allocation pie chart
- Detailed allocation table with ticker weights
- Option to download the allocation as a CSV file

## Customization

You can customize the dashboard by modifying the following files:

- `portfolio_dashboard.py`: Change the UI layout, add new visualizations, or modify existing ones
- `generate_portfolio_results.py`: Adjust how portfolio results are generated or processed

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- Plotly
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Integration with Backend

The dashboard integrates with the backend optimization system by reading the output files from the portfolio optimization process. The key integration points are:

1. Reading `full_dataset_with_regimes.csv` for market regime information
2. Reading `portfolio_optimization_results.csv` for portfolio allocations and metrics

Ensure these files are generated by running the backend optimization scripts before launching the dashboard.
